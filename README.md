# Covid--19-descriptive-Analysis-for-resolving-a-potential-crisis
Background/Motivation
Life as we know it has been turned upside down due to the unprecedented circumstances brought on by covid-19.  In 2020, global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) decreased by 3.4 percent, while the forecast initially was 2.9 percent GDP growth. Many businesses and industries across the world have been severely affected and the need for sustainable measures to help these industries to not just survive but thrive is greater than ever.

Problem Statement
We can provide governments, businesses, and organizations with practical insight on how to protect their economies and workforce in times of crisis, giving them the confidence and preparedness to brave any adversity thrown their way.

Proposal
Our plan is to conduct an in-depth analysis of data sources and uncover the correlation between vaccine availability, unemployment levels, and GDP growth. Through this analytics report, we will be able to pinpoint the causes of economic instability and create measures to prevent similar recurrences in future.
